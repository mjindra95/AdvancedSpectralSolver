\section{Building a model}

How to build the model is described in detail in chapter \ref{cha:Main Window} in section \ref{model_building}. From the top Menu, in the Model section, the "Model builder" can also be called.

\section{Model storage}

The ASS provides a "Save model" feature, storing the model as a .json file with all values like guesses, boundaries, and labels. The "Load model" function allows reusing the model, eliminating the need to build a new one for routine measurements and simplifying repetitive analysis. To remove the model completely without saving it, the "Clear model" feature could be used. It could be called from the "Model builder" window itself or from the top menu.

\section{Model visibility}
For cases when the model is currently not in use but will be used later, "Enable/Disable Model" could be used. It will not delete the model, it will just change its visibility on the canvas.
