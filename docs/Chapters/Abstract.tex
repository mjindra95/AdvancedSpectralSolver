The Advanced Spectral Solver is an app specifically developed for conducting analyses in Raman spectroscopy. This tool is equipped with a range of functionalities that not only cover fundamental Raman spectrum analysis but also incorporate a set of advanced capabilities such as data filtering. The Solver allows users to engage in the analysis of one-dimensional Raman maps, which entail variations in measurement conditions, or alternatively, to conduct analysis of two-dimensional mapping, which include lateral scanning of the selected area.
