# About

This open-source Python application is designed to simplify the analysis of Raman spectroscopy data, with a particular focus on multi-peak fitting, batch data processing, and Raman spectroscopy mapping (1D and 2D). Originally developed for academic and research use, the app provides a powerful, user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter, enabling scientists and students to interactively explore and interpret Raman spectra without writing code. So far this app can work with data acquired with HORIBA and Witec equipment, but any other spectrometers could be implemented.

The application supports:
- Importing and visualizing Raman spectra, including 1D and 2D spatial maps (e.g. line scans, hyperspectral images)
- Flexible spectral fitting using standard peak models (Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt, etc.) with bounds and constraints
- Batch fitting routines for consistent analysis of multiple spectra
- Export options for peak parameters, fitted curves, and processed datasets
- Analysis of Raman map in 2D (spatial) and 1D (timescan, linescan and electrochemical potential) mode

Whether you're working on a few spectra or hundreds of Raman maps, this app aims to accelerate insights, reduce manual labor, and improve reproducibility in spectroscopic analysis.
